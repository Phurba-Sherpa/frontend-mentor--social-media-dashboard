### Continued development

I can write html and css code that works fine. But I am really bad at writing semantic html, minimal css and full fledge responsivness. Also not good with animation. Also currently I take a lot of time to build the UI. In future I will want to build more robust UI with tricks of Grid. Also want to be more effective when it comes to the timing.
